To wit, we made ourselves fools in denying the very existence of the mystical before us while the ridiculed shamans and witches, shunned and ostracised to the fringes of our numerous societies and cultures, advocated a power much greater than we could have ever imagined. Perhaps, it matters not, because when it did happen–when the world as we know it came to an end–they were as ready as the rest of us; utterly unprepared. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When the world fell, no evangelists nor missionaries were needed. We–an insolent and petulant species of semi-intelligent unbelievers…we were proselytized by the apocalypse.

                            Humanity learned and it learned fast because it had no choice. We learned of the Singularity; the quarrel of the discordant palace of heaven and its aftermath that set free its subservient angelic militants who sought self-purpose and true autonomy with newfound free-will, careering through the pearly gates of the realm above and barelling down from their world to ours like shooting stars through the skies and comets in incandescent plunge, an unholy rain of the once godly. </p>

We were stunned.

We understood that the angels worked to serve the hierarchy–you see now, that creatures created to serve must serve, even when free–and like labourers, scavenged for residual magic on which to feed themselves and their superiors. Consuming the Nephilim, their own offspring, and the most magic-sensitive of us was of little satisfaction in comparison to the sating properties of Seraphinite but conversely, to us, this metal–so powerful it could contain near infinite amounts of magical data even in miniscule quantities, and so keen it could cut even the skin of the Seraphim–had doubled value.

                            What was left of us, mankind and divine spawn, formed the resistance. An uneasy coalition of three dedicated to one purpose; finding the Seraphinite before the angels did. And so wherever the <a href="#">Eels</a> circled in the sky, drawn to the mystical shine of the pearly gates, we made sure we were there in our numbers.
